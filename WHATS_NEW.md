## 🔧 Files Updated

- `convex/auth.ts` - Now uses custom ResendOTPPasswordless provider
- `app/index.tsx` - Added redirectTo and success message
- `vercel.json` - Added proper headers for AASA files
- `app.json` - Already has Universal/App Links configured

## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Install Resend
```bash
npm install resend
```

### 2. Set API Key
In Convex dashboard, add:
```
AUTH_RESEND_KEY=re_your_key_here
```

### 3. Verify Domain in Resend
Make sure `jpickle.win` is verified in your Resend account so you can send from `onboarding@jpickle.win`

### 4. Deploy
```bash
npx expo export -p web
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Test These URLs
- ✅ https://jpickle.win/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
- ✅ https://jpickle.win/.well-known/assetlinks.json

Both should return JSON (not 404)

### 6. Android SHA256 (If Supporting Android)
```bash
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```

Copy SHA256 to `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json`, then redeploy

### 7. Rebuild App
```bash
npx expo run:ios
# or
npx expo run:android
```

2. Check inbox for beautiful email
3. Click button
